Starting out is always harder than you expect. To be fair, continuing to do something is equally harder. Take blogging for example. I have started a couple of times now thinking I would write something or the other but I never stick to it. However, I did make a differently designed blog in a different language each time. I did land a freelance gig that way, improving my personal portfolios.

As time has passed I have grown to utterly dislike self help books. So full of fecal matter (I am trying to write cleanly here! Bare with me until my vocabulary develops). They quote philosophers and make a motivating narrative and its just not helping my already dead desire to improve. 'Atomic Habits', though is a good one. I mean I like one of his ideas where the author talks about identity and how we habitually do stuff that becomes part of our identity. Saying 'thank you' for example, a lot of people do that even after developing later stage Alzhermiers disease (Did I just throw in a science tid bit? Yes can't help my science brain can I?). I need to incorporate the idea of a writer in me or so I guess.

So this is it, the start of my blogging career yet again. Weekly, monthly or yearly I do not know. What I do know is that I hope I keep on writing little here and there.
