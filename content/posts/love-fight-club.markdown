ðŸ”´ SPOILER ALERT

Fight Club the movie and the book are one of my favourites of all time. I think the way you perceive the story changes with your age. I felt like writing an appreciation post about the movie this cloudy morning in the aftermath of Eunice. I don't know what that says about me, but the movie does get misunderstood a lot, which I have noticed in various Reddit posts. People either treat it like a cult movie, which it is, or a misogynistic one.

I first saw the movie when I was 19 and I connected with Tyler a lot and his philosophies. Like his ideas on anti-consumerism, us being the middle child of the history straddling with a mental health without cause. But it were always the dialogues that I found funny. I very quote heavy movie and a very quirky movie. Nothing more than that.

But then the COVID pandemic came along. Like everyone I tried my hand on a stringed instrument starting with the ukulele (side note: I graduated to guitar). Now there's only so much you can do besides obviously university work. So, what did I do? I started with watching movies. The thing with me is I like repeating my movies every year so that I liked very much. Fight Club was free for some reason on Amazon Prime (still is in the UK).

This time I was 21, going through somewhat of an identity crisis but that's a story for another time. This time around I felt Fight Club seemed about embracing masculinity as in how Tyler always talks about being raised by women. Tyler's misogyny became apparent and kind of scary. The story seemed to glorify masculinity, for example how Marla likes Tyler, but not the Narrator. Narrator creates a character who is masculine just to deal with his daily problems. Now it wasn't really......glorifying in the sense that Tyler must be killed, and Narrator is embraced by Marla even in his "broken" state. So, it's almost felt like the movie was about coming to terms with yourself and that is how people except you and the world is "saved". The book disagrees with the ending as far as I think. The point being ending is different. Read and watch both! 

Pandemic did not end, neither did my boredom as I entailed on 2021. I graduated to an electric guitar (finally!), and I started reading more and more books that weren't self-help. I know I can't stand self-help books now, but they got me into reading. Tastes change and so does your view on movies and books. I embarked on reading Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk. Now Chuck's writing is unreliable when it comes to narratives, and who at one point narrates. Other than that, the way his characters talk is just immaculate. The movie, I realized was very very true to the source material.  Words cannot explain the fast cut narrative, jumps to next scene and overall dashing descriptions of dingy places. At 22, I think I can settle with my explanation now. Itâ€™s about a character who has been raised in a patriarchal society (Narrator's dad marrying aka setting up franchises) grows up with a distorted view on women (Marla Singer seems like the submissive version of a sadomasochistic man), hates consumerism thus dissociates from his "real" identity to control the world (megalothymia) and in the process becomes the very thing (creating a hypermasculine army) he wanted to destroy (Corporate Consumerism, controlling the world).

Now Fight Club is one of my favourite movies, and therefore I continue seeing it through my changing perspectives in life. Would other movies have me change how I perceive on rewatches. I don't know. But I do know that we should keep rebuilding our narratives. As Nietzsche once said:

> "The will to system is a lack of integrity".
