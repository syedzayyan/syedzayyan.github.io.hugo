### Introduction
Killing Eve season 4 is on the floors and amidst all the reviews that are bewitching the show, I digress - well not completely but you get the gist. At the time of writing 4 episodes have come out and I have some opinions. I feel Season 4 should have been Season 3, Vilanelle should get killed, Kenny shouldn't have died and the Helené-Eve dynamic that is going on actually makes sense. I will explain them in not so great order

### Vilanelle should get killed
I feel this is a no-brainer. Vilanelle with all her cuteness and irritating Eve and Konstantin is still a killer. A cold-blooded psychopath and psychopaths usually don't change. Now even if we toss aside reality (which you really can't) and believe psychopaths change (which they don't, even the psychiatrist in the show says that!) Vilanelle is still a killer! She kill(ed/s?) people for a living. Not killing her and uniting her with Eve would just glorify killing. I got the memo where they mentioned it's a dark comedy, but the way and tone the show is set in, her union with Eve does not really seem all that sarcastic.

Heck, I think even Eve should get killed. Well, to be fair and it would also be kind of funny if Eve gets killed in the hands of Vilanelle. So all that running around through seasons would be worthless. I would actually like this more, but that's just me. It would fulfill the title, Eve's arc as a character (because she herself is a psychopath who let other people be collateral damage via Vilanelle) and Vilanelle still remains a psychopath without being a bore. Vilanelle just gets exhausted from the addictive control over Eve (which she seems to be losing now that Eve is a free psychopath with Helené).

### Helené-Eve dynamic makes sense

Helené and Eve are around the same age, kind of psychopaths with weird secrets and attached to Vilanelle in some way. It just does kind of make sense. The dynamic is more ominous and maybe a little less quirky than the VilanEve dynamic.

### Kenny shouldn't have died

I mean do I need to explain this even. The way season 3 went and how VilanEve evolved, but even then Kenny was the support for Eve. I think I am arguing with myself and winning myself over me! It does kind of make sense for my interpretation of Vilanelle killing Eve at the end, because V obviously gets bored.

### Season 4 should have been Season 3

I don't even remember Season 3 all that probably because so much of it is dead and boring. It could be packed in one or two episodes, except that Vilanelle visiting her family part (Emmy winning lure and very unnecessary to the story) which maybe could make a third episode. The way Season 4 is going it seems to me that they are going to turn Vilanelle into a crime fighting mush of a character while Carolyn commands the both Eve and Vilanelle. Just a boring plot that would be. Whichever way it goes it probably would not be my version of the ending.
