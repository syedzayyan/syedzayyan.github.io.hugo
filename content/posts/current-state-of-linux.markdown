Whenever, I go on YouTube I have started to see a flurry of videos that are either about:
- Gaming on Linux which usually conclude with Linux has come a long way and how it was like building custom kernels in the earlier days
- Praising a distro and how it is good enough for a regular user
- Comparing Windows and Linux and how Windows is crap and Linux is ultimate conqueror of the Earth, or
- Linus Torvalds being outrageously funny and an asshole to people (specially [NVIDIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw), which they kind of deserve).

### What about us?

Who's us, well specially me. I walk the line of amateur, musician and somewhat of a shite programmer. I think this group of people like Linux and its independence, but when copying and pasting code from a shady website, things will break eventually. Linux thus becomes a roadblock to creativity and actual work in regular life. It's fun for things and really good at some (like being a boring old server). 

### Linux, and being a musician

I am again an amateur musician. It's just horrible and Linux audio is a very good mess with your favourite DAWS. But, if you are on Linux chances are you hate pro tools, poor to get Logic and haven't found Reaper on Windows. First of all JACK. To make  Reaper work well without aweful latency you need JACK. Now before even opening your DAW if you have to run another program and fiddle to make your Audio Interface work half of motivation dies. The other half dies when you fiddle with Ardour and MIDI. Try for yourself. Coming from Reaper on Windows and using MIDI I never appreciated that. Fine! Reaper is on Windows too, but JACK is more streamlined with Ardour it seems. Yes you could use scripts to run JACK on startup but I am not hooking my Audio Interface all the time to my desktop. I just need my in built speakers sometimes.

The state of Plugins is actually good once you use Ubuntu Studio and Ardour and deal with its horrible MIDI. Video Editors include KDenlive which I kinda use on Windows anyways and I like it so honestly that is not bad.

> Pro tip: use Ubuntu Studio and everything comes built in and becomes somewhat easy to make music.

Bottom line though whenever I open my computer to compose, put down ideas or whatever I want to make music should be easy to get to. I don't want to open the terminal or configure my audio device and fiddle with the kernel on a regular basis.

### Linux being a programmer

It's a dream. Just that. Everything suddenly works and the terminal becomes a God send. I don't want to randomly add .exe files to PATH (looking at you Hugo {on windows}!) and try to fight against the computer. I use a Macbook, which is pretty streamlined with homebrew but with every update everything breaks in some way or the other. Nothing ever really broke with updates on my Linux systems.

### Linux for a student

If you're a student, you type a lot and the elephant in the room is not there. MS Office ports with wine are clunky and the Open Source alternative, coming from MS Office does not feel intuitive at all. Not to me at least. I also do stuff with genomics, which is kind of a breeze on Linux. Scientific software on Linux is just all round better on Linux.

Linux for daily web browsing and word processing is just fine. Google Docs should do most of your needs actually. It's actually very good for my student needs, but again everything becomes clunky after some point with Ubuntu Studio. Manjaro I never really had a problem with, but Ubuntu has more support. The GUI overall always seems a little bit clunky and less polished (like custom Android ROMs in some sense).

### Conclusion

I think Linux is really good for everyday users who would use just browse the web and probably use Google Docs and the out there wacky power users who code on Vim. Somewhere in between people like me would rather be happy with a Mac or Windows. But if audio on Linux become fixed, without jumping hoops of JACK and ALSA, I'll be the first one to jump ship.
