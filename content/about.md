### About Me in my broken words.

Hi! I am Zayyan. I do not like writing about myself a lot. Mostly because I don't know how to talk about myself. I am intrigued by most things in the world and at some point it seems like I am boasting my experiences. But this is an About page and I guess that is why you are here. To know about me.

Currently I am in a BSc program studying Pharmacology and Innovative Therapeutics. Basically, I make drugs or learn to make them. It's a lot of poking cells to see what drugs work in the lab, taking beautiful pictures of these cells under the "influence" and writing about them in journals. Mostly it's exciting, just not when a Western Blot fails after 2 painstaking days of work. Okay fine 1. But even then failed experiments feel bad but you bounce back like life.

I program in JS, Python and a little bit of Ruby (just enough to mantain this website). It all mostly started with Lockdown when Coursera became free and I had ample time to go through [Dr. Chuck's Introduction to Programming Specialization course](https://www.py4e.com/). Then I learnt React (yes I jumped the gun after learning only a little bit of JS). From React I went to Next.js and from there I did one freelance gig. So does that make me a professional programmer? Also, I forgot to mention I did learn a little bit of Python before in school, but it was never that deep but I helped with making a small script in hospital computer systems so that EEG files could be easily transferred between doctor's computer and the laboratory's computer. I later (lockdown) revamped that program to clean and save these reports into tabulated format so that they could be analysed in the future.

I know big jumps between the last two things and makes me a big nerd. I do play the guitar and sometimes post [embarassing covers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV5BPrngFODD_vv73Z32EWQ). This also started in the lockdown. Howeverrrr, I learnt Indian Classical for seven painful years. I had to go on weekends and practise every morning. It frankly shaped me as a human being, but I like shit on my forray into music that early as a joke. I think I joined the music academy when I were 7 or 8. I don't want to remember or check my report cards. (Secret, do not tell anyone) I used to really bad in those exams.

Okay last one, I read books too. This one only started in the lockdown. This is a new habbit. I hated reading books before, now I can't live without them. Currently I am reading, hopefully not for long, Crime and Punishment by you know who. If you don't please Google.

I will inadvertently make mistakes. See what I did there? Correct me, in Github issues or just drop me an email

### Hobby Projects

- [I made this well plate layout maker](https://syedzayyan.com/wellplate/#/). If you are a biological scientist, lab guy you came across well plates. Sometimes you need to make layouts to remember what to put where. For those times this is a new way of doing things instead of printing out a layout and writing (boring!)

- [A raspberry pi file server](https://github.com/syedzayyan/pi-file-server). This was a fun project to do with my raspberry pi. Basically Google Photos became a paid service and I went self hosted. But eh! It became a nightmare pretty soon running the Pi all the time, plus the UI implementation I would say was not the best. I was learning Go for the first time too.
