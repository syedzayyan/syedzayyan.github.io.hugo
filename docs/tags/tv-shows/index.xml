      <description>Introduction Killing Eve season 4 is on the floors and amidst all the reviews that are bewitching the show, I digress - well not completely but you get the gist. At the time of writing 4 episodes have come out and I have some opinions. I feel Season 4 should have been Season 3, Vilanelle should get killed, Kenny shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have died and the Helen√©-Eve dynamic that is going on actually makes sense.</description>
