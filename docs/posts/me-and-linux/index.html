My definition of programmer is anyone who can print 'hello world' and really understand what they are doing - before you pick up your sticks that is my definition. Disclaimers aside, I was an elitist about C++ and I would just copy and paste tutorials by ’thenewboston’ on Youtube. When I typed in Linux, Ubuntu was the first thing that came up and I tried to dual boot it on my Lenovo Laptop (it had a Celeron Processor). It naturally ran faster than Windows 8.1 and thus began a love story. I never really continued programming C++ and forgot about it, and likewise Linux. However, I would keep up with the culture like and the inside jokes.\nLinux returns in my life and distros My Celeron became unusable with time and I finally ditched Windows and moved to Linux Mint. By this time I had researched more and I found out the a problem also an advantage for Linux. It has distros. I had never event themed my Windows environment, besides changing the Wallpaper and distros just seemed more confusing. When we say Linux we usually mean an operating system at least in mainstream media. But Linux is just a kernel.\nKernel ?! The computer is a machine and machines only understand binary. The computer also happens to have various components. If we were to write binary code for each component and make them talk to each other everytime I wanted to write a blog post, I would probably not do it. Take this ELI5 post, very good explanation of transistors. Transitors because, they are sort of binary and a lot of them together and years of abstraction gives you a smartphone. What does the kernel do. It is a very lower level piece of software, under layers of abstration that basically talks to each component in the computer and communicates with the upper level software like your browser like Firefox.\nBack to distros Now what you build on top of this kernel, what kind of File System you use, different types of GUI (Graphical User Interface) is upto you. Since there are so many variations of what you can do above this Kernel, and so many programmers willing to contribute to projects you get so many distros. Even though it seems it’s just the UI but they are other things that change underneath that I won’t go into, nor do I completely understand them. Additionally a lot of these distros are based on each other. For example Linux Mint and Ubuntu both come from Debian, while Manjaro is based on Arch. Now which distro you use depends on the what community you want to be part of, what kind of job you do etcetra etcetra. For example, recently I tried Ubuntu Studio.\nWhere was I? Yes, from my Celeron Lenovo Laptop I quickly moved to a MacBook, and I forgot both programming and Linux again. This time it was my O Levels. I did continue to use Ubuntu on the laptop for a while, because if a laptop exists in home why not use it for no reason. Fast-forward, I moved to UK and lots of things happened and I got to have an iMac 2011 for cheap.\nUbuntu Studio Years before when I had tried making Music, Reaper (a very good DAW) was the ‘only’ ‘good’ DAW that ran on Linux. I know I know I was naive, but audio on Linux was a mess and it required JACK and loads of crap and yes PLUGINS. Free plugins I did not want to mess with because they were not really as streamlines as its Windows or Mac counterparts. I think that is one of the bigger problems. Other than the main programs, nothing on Linux ecosystem is really streamlined.\nAnyhoo, iMac and Windows was getting boring, Hugo did not really want to work and all the tutorial was not easy like brew install hugo. So I thought why not install Manjaro since that was breeze and Anthony from LTT liked it so much. It did not want to install for some reason so I went with the safest option - UBUNTU. I make music and DAWs are necessary in my life. Trying to set up Ardour was a nightmare so I went with Ubuntu Studio, it came with all the big audio software, plugins and even video editors.\nPerfect right? Wrong! Audio was still a mess. So basically everytime I open Ardour I have to setup my audio interface. Now if you are someone like even that tiny step to open a project or getting a new one is a very big roadblock to recording stuff. Then came the Midi Editor. If you come from Reaper, basically you edit MIDI stuff on the track by expanding it and controlling the velocity - ufff. It’s just a nightmare. Then I thought why not give Reaper a try.\nTo be fair Reaper now works really great on Ubuntu and everything works. So I continued with Ubuntu Studio for a while haggling my way through JACK and Reaper. But, I am not just a musician and a programmer. I happen to write stuff and use MS Word.\nWine and MS Word Office 365 does not work on Linux. I mean how hard is it Microsoft? You are getting the fees anyways. After countless tries to install 365 I gave up. I did not want to be a cry baby so I went on using Open Office but it’s just not intuitive enough having a whole life shaped by MS Word and specially MS Excel and MS Powerpoint. The feature set maybe the same, but just does not cut it for me for some odd reason. Feels clunky the UI. Also the fact I have relearn bascially all the nooks and cranies all over again. This is why I like Markdown. So good! Better luck explain that to Univeristy boomers.\nLinux, Sleep and GUI The iMac display is weirdly big and it needed scaling on Ubuntu Studio. The XFCE edition for some reason did not have fractional scaling. So, came the weird setup of having to update it to another version. It scaled well but things just seemed weird. Like waking from sleep the lock screen would have weird positioning, the form would be in some corner.\nThe fans on iMac does not help either, and for very weird reason, they blasted at full speed even when the OS was sleeping. Supposedly. And this is a problem that I faced with other systems as well. It’s just not the iMacs fault.\nConclusion The point is, I like Linux with its weird quirks and advantages. I really like the no nonsense terminal typing and installing stuff and I really appreciate the open source and freeness of it. The only thing that basically stops me is MS Office and that is not coming to Linux anytime soon, not unless you count Android but that is a different story. Also the weird UI hiccups that I tend to notice. Windows also has them but not this level. Basically I am becoming an Apple Fan boy. That is the conclusion.\n",

<p>I first heard about Linux when I was an aspiring programmer just fresh out of 2014. My definition of programmer is anyone who can print <code>'hello world'</code> and really understand what they are doing - before you pick up your sticks that is my definition. Disclaimers aside, I was an elitist about C++ and I would just copy and paste tutorials by &rsquo;thenewboston&rsquo; on Youtube. When I typed in Linux, Ubuntu was the first thing that came up and I tried to dual boot it on my Lenovo Laptop (it had a Celeron Processor). It naturally ran faster than Windows 8.1 and thus began a love story. I never really continued programming C++ and forgot about it, and likewise Linux. However, I would keep up with the culture like and the inside jokes.</p>

The feature set maybe the same, but just does not cut it for me for some odd reason. Feels clunky the UI. Also the fact I have relearn bascially all the nooks and cranies all over again. This is why I like Markdown. So good! Better luck explain that to Univeristy boomers.</p>

<p>The iMac display is weirdly big and it needed scaling on Ubuntu Studio. The XFCE edition for some reason did not have fractional scaling. So, came the weird setup of having to update it to another version. It scaled well but things just seemed weird. Like waking from sleep the lock screen would have weird positioning, the form would be in some corner.</p>
<p>The fans on iMac does not help either, and for very weird reason, they blasted at full speed even when the OS was sleeping. Supposedly. And this is a problem that I faced with other systems as well. It&rsquo;s just not the iMacs fault.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>The point is, I like Linux with its weird quirks and advantages. I really like the no nonsense terminal typing and installing stuff and I really appreciate the open source and freeness of it. The only thing that basically stops me is MS Office and that is not coming to Linux anytime soon, not unless you count Android but that is a different story. Also the weird UI hiccups that I tend to notice. Windows also has them but not this level. Basically I am becoming an Apple Fan boy. That is the conclusion.</p>
