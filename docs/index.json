[{"content":"Introduction Killing Eve season 4 is on the floors and amidst all the reviews that are bewitching the show, I digress - well not completely but you get the gist. At the time of writing 4 episodes have come out and I have some opinions. I feel Season 4 should have been Season 3, Vilanelle should get killed, Kenny shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have died and the Helené-Eve dynamic that is going on actually makes sense. I will explain them in not so great order\nVilanelle should get killed I feel this is a no-brainer. Vilanelle with all her cuteness and irritating Eve and Konstantin is still a killer. A cold-blooded psychopath and psychopaths usually don\u0026rsquo;t change. Now even if we toss aside reality (which you really can\u0026rsquo;t) and believe psychopaths change (which they don\u0026rsquo;t, even the psychiatrist in the show says that!) Vilanelle is still a killer! She kill(ed/s?) people for a living. Not killing her and uniting her with Eve would just glorify killing. I got the memo where they mentioned it\u0026rsquo;s a dark comedy, but the way and tone the show is set in, her union with Eve does not really seem all that sarcastic.\nHeck, I think even Eve should get killed. Well, to be fair and it would also be kind of funny if Eve gets killed in the hands of Vilanelle. So all that running around through seasons would be worthless. I would actually like this more, but that\u0026rsquo;s just me. It would fulfill the title, Eve\u0026rsquo;s arc as a character (because she herself is a psychopath who let other people be collateral damage via Vilanelle) and Vilanelle still remains a psychopath without being a bore. Vilanelle just gets exhausted from the addictive control over Eve (which she seems to be losing now that Eve is a free psychopath with Helené).\nHelené-Eve dynamic makes sense Helené and Eve are around the same age, kind of psychopaths with weird secrets and attached to Vilanelle in some way. It just does kind of make sense. The dynamic is more ominous and maybe a little less quirky than the VilanEve dynamic.\nKenny shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have died I mean do I need to explain this even. The way season 3 went and how VilanEve evolved, but even then Kenny was the support for Eve. I think I am arguing with myself and winning myself over me! It does kind of make sense for my interpretation of Vilanelle killing Eve at the end, because V obviously gets bored.\nSeason 4 should have been Season 3 I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember Season 3 all that probably because so much of it is dead and boring. It could be packed in one or two episodes, except that Vilanelle visiting her family part (Emmy winning lure and very unnecessary to the story) which maybe could make a third episode. The way Season 4 is going it seems to me that they are going to turn Vilanelle into a crime fighting mush of a character while Carolyn commands the both Eve and Vilanelle. Just a boring plot that would be. Whichever way it goes it probably would not be my version of the ending.\n","permalink":"https://syedzayyan.com/posts/killing-eve-season4-not-bad/","summary":"Introduction Killing Eve season 4 is on the floors and amidst all the reviews that are bewitching the show, I digress - well not completely but you get the gist.

The more I experience things, the more I feel I have grown as a person and spent more time on this planet. The London tube sort of takes away that experience of traveling on foot or on a bus and seeing the city. I feel this way partly because I use the same line everyday, and probably see the same people. However, no one really looks at each other on the tube, and it\u0026rsquo;s usually me reading a book or listening to heavy metal to drown out the harsh sound of the central line, gazing aimlessly outside the windows as I bob my head to the blast beats. On a bus, I have a window into life on the road and very different sorts of people on the bus itself. On foot it is even more interesting, seeing other people wheeze through into the hustle-bustle.\nI live in a small town called Ashford. I will skip the boring details, but I have to travel to London weekly, to attend in-person lectures for my bachelors in Pharmacology at QMUL. I could have skipped lectures on the 3rd of March 2022. I did not partly because I am a massive idiot and partly because I thought I could just use the bus with ease. I forgot buses would have to handle the extra pressure and take more time. There was something else I noticed throughout the strike. London without a tube is just like a person without a personality. The tube almost defines London for me now. Yes you do have your parks, old timely buildings, a funny blue bridge - but you get them in other cities as well. Well maybe not the blue bridge but the tube just is like the icing on the cake. The nebulousness of the network, hot airtight carriages, the busy stations and the noise. It\u0026rsquo;s like a whole city underneath the main city. I saw a stream of people as I sat on the bus today. It almost felt as if half of these people live in the tube.\nI take the bus regularly in Ashford. One thing is common between buses in a town and the city. They are always late and always on time when you are late. I feel this is an unwritten rule. Today was a bad day, but I traveled on buses in London before the lockdown. It has the same exact timing phenomenon. People on the bus seem to be a lot more varied in London. It\u0026rsquo;s always different kinds of characters that get on the buses. The drivers are bit more jerky, but I blame the city\u0026rsquo;s insufferable traffic for that. In the town, the drivers are slower and sober. It\u0026rsquo;s always the same kind of people on the bus. Usually its: a couple of elderly ladies and gents; a teenage boy almost as if diving into his phone; a teenage girl clearly in their rebel phase with gothic kind of makeup; a handful of children making irritable noises incessantly as their guardians bang their heads regretting not using a condom and a few doctors here and there (the bus line I use has a hospital at one end).\nThe tube however does not give a chance to glance at people. Partly because I am scared to make eye contact, and partly because everyone is looking down on their phones or reading a book. But there\u0026rsquo;s always similar kinds of people. The bookish ones deep and lost in their texts (this is me), the bobbing their head ones to trap beats, the staring blankly at the window ones, the creep undressing their victim with sheer power of their eyes, the couple making out near the door (it specially hurts during Valentine week) and sometimes an elderly couple. It\u0026rsquo;s always old people coupled on tubes. Always. Always restores my faith in love.\nDespite all the new experiences (I did not want to) I\u0026rsquo;d rather have a mundane journey, because you could only observe so much and experience the difference. The routes will be same, and sooner or later the person on the buses will be same. There will be some other stereotype I will find, and my window into the world will soon be replaced by another book. London traffic will kill me before any of that happens. It\u0026rsquo;s so much faster on the tube! But I do feel, now I would take a bus on and off and hopefully not because of a strike. Sometimes, I will need my window into the world in my journey and the buses dawned in red will be ready just late by half an hour.\n","permalink":"https://syedzayyan.com/posts/a-day-in-london-without-the-tube/","summary":"Our perception of time is strongly linked to our memories.

To be fair I am anxious as a knock-on effect. Now if we have learned anything from the 1940s, you don\u0026rsquo;t even need balls to deharmonise the world. One ball is just enough. But we are human beings and we do not learn from our blunders. We make them again and again. 1940s was a curious case of identity politics at play and how it takes one psychopath, with a broken sense of identity. We like to classify it into a religion box, perhaps a racial discrimination box but that\u0026rsquo;s what it was - a person with a distorted sense of identity. Is it true for Russia, with a new wave Hitler helmed as the president?\nVladimir Putin\u0026rsquo;s Russia can be easily dismissed as the old school geopolitics fightings its end, but that is boring (although good enough for a drawing room discussion), it is complicated and marred by the situation that Russia has brought onto itself by attacking Ukraine. What Putin, brought to Russian politics was ideology. What a heavy word to throw in, but essentially it means a collection of ideas that forms the basis of an economic policy.\nNow why is ideology necessary? Human beings have an apparent need to be identified (isothymia) as being equal to others. The line of feeling this \u0026ldquo;equalness\u0026rdquo; (for the lack of a better word) can be anything really. On a basic level, being considered a human and on a superficial level it could be like being associated with a culture. And, to form a nation an association is needed that unites people. Why else would you go to think of best interests of a collection of people even to an extent that you go to war with other nations to act in the best interest (jingoism)?\nBack to Russia. What is their ideology? Post USSR Russia did not really have an ideology, considering communism that took the crown for an ideology failed miserably. The rise of Putin and his foreign policy indicates that the Russian people subconsciously needed just a common enemy. A common enemy is a very good factor that could constitute a nation. The West has played the role of an enemy with ease by pushing NATO eastwards and vindicating Russia as a villain. The more Russia feels threatened by such actions, as in not accounting its collective identity and its intentions, the more they tend to fight back (aggresive foreign policies). It\u0026rsquo;s as if the West has stopped accounting Russia as an equal by its vindictive actions. And this feeling of injustice is not a subconscious and hidden fact, rather something that has been translated and transmitted by many media outlets, in the West.\nPutin became the poster boy of an ideology wrapped in nostalgia. Besides being an ex-USSR guy, he wants everyone under that banner again however banal and barmy that maybe.\nNow that alone does not account for Russia\u0026rsquo;s and specifically Putin\u0026rsquo;s actions. Putin does have megalothymic (treating onself as more than others) tendencies. Now if you know about Psychopaths and the Bob Hare checklist, that is one of the items, grandiose sense of self. And Bob Hare has himself questioned if there are couple of psychopaths that topple world order with their madness and that is an interesting fact to consider. And a quick Google search confirms you that (, but seriously they are legitimate pieces on this). So is it really that something hurt a madman\u0026rsquo;s sense of identity? I think it is. However crazy that idea is (I know ironic!) I think there is some truth to this. Just like the UBLs, Hitlers and the Mussolinis of the world I feel it is a madman hurt, and we are doing absolutely nothing to address that problem. To be fair there\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can really do. It\u0026rsquo;s just the rule of the world now to engage in wars each lifetime until we kill off each other.\nReferences:\n Identity: Contemporary Identity Politics and the Struggle for Recognition by Francis Fukuyama The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson https://www.jstor.org/stable/26414074  ","permalink":"https://syedzayyan.com/posts/the-world-ends/","summary":"As I sit across my laptop screen, panicking and being anxious about the point of existence, there are people with their worlds toppling over.

I think the way you perceive the story changes with your age. I felt like writing an appreciation post about the movie this cloudy morning in the aftermath of Eunice. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what that says about me, but the movie does get misunderstood a lot, which I have noticed in various Reddit posts. People either treat it like a cult movie, which it is, or a misogynistic one.\nI first saw the movie when I was 19 and I connected with Tyler a lot and his philosophies. Like his ideas on anti-consumerism, us being the middle child of the history straddling with a mental health without cause. But it were always the dialogues that I found funny. I very quote heavy movie and a very quirky movie. Nothing more than that.\nBut then the COVID pandemic came along. Like everyone I tried my hand on a stringed instrument starting with the ukulele (side note: I graduated to guitar). Now there\u0026rsquo;s only so much you can do besides obviously university work. So, what did I do? I started with watching movies. The thing with me is I like repeating my movies every year so that I liked very much. Fight Club was free for some reason on Amazon Prime (still is in the UK).\nThis time I was 21, going through somewhat of an identity crisis but that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another time. This time around I felt Fight Club seemed about embracing masculinity as in how Tyler always talks about being raised by women. Tyler\u0026rsquo;s misogyny became apparent and kind of scary. The story seemed to glorify masculinity, for example how Marla likes Tyler, but not the Narrator. Narrator creates a character who is masculine just to deal with his daily problems. Now it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;glorifying in the sense that Tyler must be killed, and Narrator is embraced by Marla even in his \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; state. So, it\u0026rsquo;s almost felt like the movie was about coming to terms with yourself and that is how people except you and the world is \u0026ldquo;saved\u0026rdquo;. The book disagrees with the ending as far as I think. The point being ending is different. Read and watch both!\nPandemic did not end, neither did my boredom as I entailed on 2021. I graduated to an electric guitar (finally!), and I started reading more and more books that weren\u0026rsquo;t self-help. I know I can\u0026rsquo;t stand self-help books now, but they got me into reading. Tastes change and so does your view on movies and books. I embarked on reading Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk. Now Chuck\u0026rsquo;s writing is unreliable when it comes to narratives, and who at one point narrates. Other than that, the way his characters talk is just immaculate. The movie, I realized was very very true to the source material. Words cannot explain the fast cut narrative, jumps to next scene and overall dashing descriptions of dingy places. At 22, I think I can settle with my explanation now. It’s about a character who has been raised in a patriarchal society (Narrator\u0026rsquo;s dad marrying aka setting up franchises) grows up with a distorted view on women (Marla Singer seems like the submissive version of a sadomasochistic man), hates consumerism thus dissociates from his \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; identity to control the world (megalothymia) and in the process becomes the very thing (creating a hypermasculine army) he wanted to destroy (Corporate Consumerism, controlling the world).\nNow Fight Club is one of my favourite movies, and therefore I continue seeing it through my changing perspectives in life. Would other movies have me change how I perceive on rewatches. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But I do know that we should keep rebuilding our narratives. As Nietzsche once said:\n \u0026ldquo;The will to system is a lack of integrity\u0026rdquo;.\n ","permalink":"https://syedzayyan.com/posts/love-fight-club/","summary":"🔴 SPOILER ALERT\nFight Club the movie and the book are one of my favourites of all time.

Since then it had been collecting dust. I should have considered my experience with programming and the few stints that had happened along the way before making such an impulse buy. But, hey! That\u0026rsquo;s why they are called impulses. However, COVID happened, and Coursera was almost free for half the year. I enrolled in a bunch of courses, I built a few things along the way, including the website you are on right now. I thought of giving the Pi another try.\nThe Shopping I got inspired to build a weather station from this Reddit post. I got onto Pi Hut again. I bought:\n A header, because I didn’t have headers on my Pi An LCD display, A 1.14 inch tiny WaveShare LCD display A network HAT An ethernet cable A cute little fan  Tan tan tana!! Problem. A very ultra silly mistake too. I didn’t have a soldering iron. Don’t be me and try to bend the around pins by hand. The contacts are unstable and it just does not work. I did not take a picture to torture your eyes and partly because I did not plan that I was going to make a blog post. And the project got side-lined. I got busy doing other things. But on Prime Day, Pi Hut also offered free delivery.\nSolution ? Luckily there are these hammer headers for people like me who can’t solder to save their lives. If you don’t like the sound of hammering your Pi, buy them with pre-soldered headers. Again don’t be me.\nThe coding phase I thought I could copy the code from u/tehargus, with some minor adjustments. But being the miser I am I bought a different cheaper mini LCD display. Fortunately Waveshare had a bunch of guides on their website, and I ditched the code from u/tehargus. The code is pretty self explanatory. It has an infinite loop up top that runs every 100 seconds. It consumes the Open Weather API and prints the contents to the screen. Specifically the:\n Minimum and Maximum temperatures for the day What it feels like The current temperature The probability of rain Prints the CPU temperature. Not from the API, (duh!).  The code requires a .env file as it requires:\n API_KEY LOCATION LATITUDE LONGITUDE  At the end of the loop there\u0026rsquo;s a 100 second sleep because in the free version Open Weather only allows 1000 API calls a day. If I did my calculation right 100 seconds intervals should be enough. Perks of copying code\nThe folder structure is complicated. I know. Font and Lib came from Waveshare tutorials. I didn’t touch it because I was scared to break things again. The pic folder contains the pictures from OpenWeather to be displayed. The main folder contains main.py with the actual code. You can tinker around if you’d like. :) Here’s the finished product.\nThe case. You might be asking why it’s in a Seagate One Touch Hard Disk box, with a fan and ethernet port that only consumes an API. Because it’s connected to a 2TB hard drive that’s inside. Here’s a sneak peak.\nPoorly written Golang The Pi also runs an HTTP File server I wrote in Golang. Here’s the code for it. Maybe I’d write about it some other day when I am well versed with Golang. But in short it has a bunch of API endpoints that can be used for reading, putting and deleting files on the disk. A SvelteJS frontend consumes those APIs. So, if you have a Pi, don’t let it collect dust. It’s a powerful little machine that can do just about anything you can imagine. Probably not running your machine learning algorithms, but a weather station is a start!\n P.S The Pi also runs Pi Hole.

It\u0026rsquo;s a lot of poking cells to see what drugs work in the lab, taking beautiful pictures of these cells under the \u0026ldquo;influence\u0026rdquo; and writing about them in journals. Mostly it\u0026rsquo;s exciting, just not when a Western Blot fails after 2 painstaking days of work. Okay fine 1. But even then failed experiments feel bad but you bounce back like life.\nI program in JS, Python and a little bit of Ruby (just enough to mantain this website). It all mostly started with Lockdown when Coursera became free and I had ample time to go through Dr. Chuck\u0026rsquo;s Introduction to Programming Specialization course. Then I learnt React (yes I jumped the gun after learning only a little bit of JS). From React I went to Next.js and from there I did one freelance gig. So does that make me a professional programmer? Also, I forgot to mention I did learn a little bit of Python before in school, but it was never that deep but I helped with making a small script in hospital computer systems so that EEG files could be easily transferred between doctor\u0026rsquo;s computer and the laboratory\u0026rsquo;s computer. I later (lockdown) revamped that program to clean and save these reports into tabulated format so that they could be analysed in the future.\nI know big jumps between the last two things and makes me a big nerd.
